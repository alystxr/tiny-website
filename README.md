<h1> Welcome to my <a href=https://tinywebsite-ac3b5.web.app/>tiny website!</a></h1>
<p> I've always wanted to create a website, but I wanted to try doing it all with code (no squarespace and things like that) - and I also didn't know what to do about hosting (Didn't want to deal with limitations or subscriptions or pricing of domains)</p>
<p><br>But then, I stumbled apon this:</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/guides/tiny_website">How to code a tiny website</a></p>
<p>it was perfect and now I'm super inspired and have already made one!</p>

<p>now I just have to figure out what to do....<br>pray for me on this journey!</p>
